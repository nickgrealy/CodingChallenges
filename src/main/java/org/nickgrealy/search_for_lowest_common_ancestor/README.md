# Challenge:

Given a BST (Binary Search Tree), write a function that receives the root of the tree, and 2 values, then find the LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor).

1. the 2 nodes must have a shared root
2. the first node value provided, is the "left" side node (ergo second node is "right" side)
3. the 2 nodes are not descendants of each other.
